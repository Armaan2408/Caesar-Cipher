# Caesar-Cipher


This tool provides a basic implementation of the Caesar cipher for encrypting and decrypting plaintext or ciphertext. The Caesar cipher is a classical encryption technique that shifts each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.


## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.11.4

## How to Use

1. **Run the Script**:
   - Open the Python script in any IDE or run it in your preferred environment.

2. **Follow the Instructions**:
   - Upon execution, the script will prompt you with options to encrypt or decrypt a message.
   - Provide the required inputs such as the string, shift value, and operation type.

3. **Experiment**:
   - Feel free to try different shift values and messages to see how the Caesar cipher transforms them.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter '1' to encrypt
Enter '2' to decrypt
Enter exit to terminate: 1
Enter a string to encrypt: Hello World
Enter a shift: 3
Encrypted string: Khoor Zruog
------------------------------------
Enter '1' to encrypt
Enter '2' to decrypt
Enter exit to terminate: 2
Enter a string to decrypt: Khoor Zruog
Enter a shift: 3
Decrypted string: Hello World
------------------------------------
Enter '1' to encrypt
Enter '2' to decrypt
Enter exit to terminate: exit
Thank you
